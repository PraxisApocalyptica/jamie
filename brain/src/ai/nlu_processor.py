# This module processes raw text input from the user (via Vision app)
# to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information (entities).

# Examples:
# "Pick up the red ball" -> Intent: PickUp, Entities: {object: "ball", color: "red"}
# "Go to the kitchen" -> Intent: GoTo, Entities: {location: "kitchen"}
# "What is that?" -> Intent: Identify, Entities: {target: "that"} # "that" might refer to a visually perceived object
