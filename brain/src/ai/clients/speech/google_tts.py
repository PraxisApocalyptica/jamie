# --- 1. Prerequisites ---
# BEFORE RUNNING THIS CODE:
# a) Install the necessary libraries:
#    pip install gtts pydub
# b) Install FFmpeg or Libav:
#    - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install ffmpeg
#    - macOS: brew install ffmpeg
#    - Windows: Download and add ffmpeg to PATH (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
# c) Requires an active internet connection for gtts synthesis.
# d) Ensure your system has a compatible audio player that pydub can use (e.g., aplay, afplay).
